/*
You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters 
long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should have different 
heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an array 
H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters 
to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's 
left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.

The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such 
blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks
needed to build the wall.

Write a function:

function solution(H);

that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the wall, 
returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.

For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:

  H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
  H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
  H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of 
seven blocks.



Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

// 100% O(N)
function solution (H) {
  // set up our stack
  const stack = [];
  // cache our length
  const len = H.length;
  // set up our block counter
  let blocks = 0;

  // scan our array
  for (let i = 0; i< len; i++) {
    // our stack isn't empty or starting with the highest, so clear it out
    while (stack.length && stack[stack.length-1] > H[i]) {
      stack.pop();
    }

    if (!stack.length) {
      // stack is empty
      blocks += 1; // add block
      stack.push(H[i]); // push to stack
    } else if (stack[stack.length-1] < H[i]) {
      // low to high
      blocks += 1; // add block
      stack.push(H[i]); // push to stack
    } else if (stack[stack.length-1] === H[i]) {
      // same height, do nothing
    }
  }
}
