# computer-science-practice

This is a repo that conatains information, common data structures, algorithms, and interview style problems. I put this repo together to help refresh, learn, and study for interviews. Included is answers to specific questions from common Data Structures and Algorithms practice sites like [LeetCode](./src/leetcode/) and [Codility](./src/codility/).

## Repo Contents

- [Data Structures and Algorithms](./src/dataStructuresAlgorithms/)
- [Common Problems](./src/problems/)
- [LeetCode Solutions](./src/leetcode/)
- [Codility Solutions](./src/codility/)
- [Cloud Computing](./src/cloud/)
- [Fundamentals](./src/fundamentals/)
- [System Design](./src/systems-design/)
